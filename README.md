# Java-Examples

This is a final project from my Java course that included a representation of everything we learned during the semester. The assignment was to extend an existing class and create a new class "hourly employee". Once that was complete we were to create a calculator that would calculate the hourly employee's pay along with tax information. The project also included requirements to use a toString override from the superclass as well as throwing exceptions using both the try/catch method as well as the throw method.
